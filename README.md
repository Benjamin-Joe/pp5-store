# Target Audience 
The products on this website are mainly aimed at the following:  
Creative/Artistic people  
People buying gifts for a loved one  
People looking for something unique  
Art lovers  
The age group that this website aims to target are people between the ages of 35 and 55. I am aiming this site at the groups above because I have attended and hosted several art galleries and these are the average customer type that I have come across.  
In order to be as effective as possible I am designing this website to be as efficient as possible whilst also being full of useful information about the products availiable to purchase. To better reach my target audience I believe that Facebook is the best platform to advertise this website. Which is why I have created a Facebook business page. I also intend to create repeat business by offering unique discounts/rewards to shoppers and holding free giveaways on Facebook to make customers feel important.
