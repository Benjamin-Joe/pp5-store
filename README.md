# Target Audience 

The products on this website are mainly aimed at the following:  
Creative/Artistic people  
People buying gifts for a loved one  
People looking for something unique  
Art lovers  
The age group that this website aims to target are people between the ages of 35 and 55. I am aiming this site at the groups above because I have attended and hosted several art galleries and these are the average customer type that I have come across.  
In order to be as effective as possible I am designing this website to be as efficient as possible whilst also being full of useful information about the products availiable to purchase. To better reach my target audience I believe that Facebook is the best platform to advertise this website. Which is why I have created a Facebook business page. I also intend to create repeat business by offering unique discounts/rewards to shoppers and holding free giveaways on Facebook to make customers feel important.

# Build
Building this website was a fun challenge. It was made a lot easier by using the Boutique Ado walkthrough videos as a rough guide to keep me on the right trach for hitting all of the assessment criteria. By copying all of the allauth templates into it's own folder I was able to have access to design the pages to my own tastes. Having this control made the whole authentication proccess much simpler.
