# Target Audience 
The products on this website are mainly aimed at the following:  
Creative/Artistic people  
People buying gifts for a loved one  
People looking for something unique  
Art lovers  
The age group that this website aims to target are people between the ages of 35 and 55. I am aiming this site at the groups above because I have attended and hosted several art galleries and these are the average customer type that I have come across.  
In order to be as effective as possible I am designing this website to be as efficient as possible whilst also being full of useful information about the products availiable to purchase. To better reach my target audience I believe that Facebook is the best platform to advertise this website. Which is why I have created a Facebook business page. I also intend to create repeat business by offering unique discounts/rewards to shoppers and holding free giveaways on Facebook to make customers feel important.

# Build
Building this website was a fun challenge. It was made a lot easier by using the Boutique Ado walkthrough videos as a rough guide to keep me on the right trach for hitting all of the assessment criteria. By copying all of the allauth templates into it's own folder I was able to have access to design the pages to my own tastes. Having this control made the whole authentication proccess much simpler.  
The navigation bar came straight from the bootstrap documentation and was adapted to suit the style of this website. The font for the navigation bar is Source Serif 4. I choose this font as it stands out quite nicely against the nav bar background and looks very professional.

Underneath the main navbar is a second bar for sorting products via category, price, rating and deals. By having this seperate to the main navigation bar I feel it improves user experience and creates a higher chance that users will engage with it's features
